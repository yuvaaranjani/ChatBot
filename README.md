# ChatBot

This chatbot mini-project offers users two distinctive models for interactive engagement. The first model presents a standalone web page dedicated solely to the chatbot, providing users with a focused environment for conversation. For my own college admission purpose.

In the second model, the chatbot is seamlessly integrated into a sample web page. This embedded approach enables users to interact with the chatbot while navigating other content on the page, creating a cohesive and integrated user experience. Both models prioritize user-friendly and interactive conversational interfaces, showcasing the adaptability of chatbot deployment. Whether users seek a dedicated chatbot interaction or prefer an integrated experience within a broader web context, this mini-project highlights the versatility of incorporating chatbots to enhance web applications.
